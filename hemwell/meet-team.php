	<h2>Dr. Shiraz Farooq</h2>
	<h4 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Double Board Certified Colorectal Surgeon</h4>

	<p>As Chief Medical Officer and Co-Founder of HemWell America, my singular goal is to help our patients, who suffer from hemorrhoidal pain/bleeding and common anorectal ailments. The majority of these symptoms are ignored for too long by patients and doctors alike. </p>

	<p>The founding principles of HemWell America are compassion for the patients, and innovation in latest non-surgical techniques. We realize that most people are afraid, embarrassed and worried about treatment options. Everyone has heard tales of prolonged suffering and pain associated with traditional methods. Our commitment is to provide the least invasive treatment, while making the whole experience as comfortable and pleasant as possible.</p>
	 
	<p>My medical and surgical career began overseas, where I received multiple academic gold medals. I spent another seven years in surgical residency, and two fellowships, including Critical Care Surgery and Colon and Rectal Surgery in New York and Ohio.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:30px!important;">At HemWell America, we have a team of dedicated trained and supervised medical professionals that give the patient the best experience we can.  From the first phone call to the moment our patients leave our clinics, we are committed to principles of clinical excellence and patient satisfaction. </p>

	<h2 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Lisa Ferris, ARNP – BC  </h2>

	<p>As Center Director and Lead Provider of our N. Armenia Ave clinic in beautiful South Tampa, Florida, I have seen patients with a wide range of complaints, from simple itching, minor bleeding, and internal hemorrhoids to severe and sometimes sudden rectal pain from anal fissures, fistulas, abscess’ and external thrombosis, and have even diagnosed anal cancers.</p>

	<p>I am expert at diagnosing anal-rectal pathology, having received one-on-one specialty training by colorectal surgeons, and by both GI and Family practice providers. I am also well trained in several office-based treatment methodologies, always emphasizing the least invasive treatments first. I will explain the choices available, and work with you to make a plan just for you, that fits your lifestyle and goals. </p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:30px!important;">Here at HemWell America, we are determined to help you feel better as quickly and painlessly as possible, from the moment you call, or walk into one of our clinics. We offer a welcoming, relaxing environment, and friendly and compassionate medical assistants and providers, who are all ready to do their very best , and to go the extra mile to get you well.
