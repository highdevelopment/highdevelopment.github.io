	<ol style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
		<li>Finally, there’s a quick, easy and proven alternative to hemorrhoid surgery.</li>
		<li>Our treatment utilizes an advanced technology to treat problematic hemorrhoids.</li>
		<li>The treatment targets the blood vessel which feeds the hemorrhoid ligating the blood vessel and cutting off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid.</li>
		<li>The blood flow to the hemorrhoid is interrupted and it begins to shrink.</li>
		<li>Since the hemorrhoid has lost its connection with the feeding vessel, it continues to shrink during the 7-10 days following treatment.</li>
		<li>Many will even experience immediate relief. Following treatment,  patients are able to return to their usual activities the same day.</li>
	</ol>
