	<h1 class="title smaller">Anal Fistula</h1>
	
	<p>	Think of anal fistula as a tunnel between the anal canal and the outside skin. The external opening is near the anus from which a small amount of pus or blood may discharge. There is sometimes a small lump that may be uncomfortable. The symptoms are often intermittent. A fistula sometimes develops after drainage of an abscess but it may occur spontaneously. Patients with Crohnâ€™s disease are more likely to develop fistulae but most people with a fistula do not have any other bowel disease. </p>

	<p>Fistulae rarely heal by themselves and surgery is nearly always required.</p>
