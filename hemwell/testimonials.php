	I have suffered with hemorrhoids for the last 33 years. They started when I was just 14 years old. Back in 2005 I had the hemorrhoidectomy surgery and it was horrific. The doctor was only able to remove 25% of the hemorrhoids, I had them so bad. I had back surgery and that surgery was easier than the hemorrhoidectomy surgery. So over the last 9 years I have continued to suffer with bleeding and itching. The hemorrhoids controlled my life. Every time I wanted to go out I would have to thinking about where the closest bathroom was and many times would decide not to even go because I was suffering so bad. So finally in the Spring of this year, I couldn’t take it any longer and decided I would have to go back and have the hemorrhoidectomy surgery. I just was not able to enjoy life. However, one day I was talking to a friend of mine that told me about this treatment and HemWell America. I knew I had to at least give it a try, what did I have to lose? So I had a consultation and initial exam. The nurse and assistant were so helpful, they explained about the quick 10-minute treatment and there was no preparation at all. I decided to have the treatment right then. It was not painful at all and literally about 10 minutes later the treatment was done. I immediately felt relief from my symptoms and was able to just walk home. Because of how bad I had hemorrhoids I had 3 more treatments and I can say today, I am hemorrhoid free. I honestly can not believe that I almost had to go through surgery again but HemWell America has cured my suffering from hemorrhoids. It has been life changing for me. I ride 25 miles a week on my bike, I run in marathons, I go out with friends without having to think twice if there will be a restroom close by. I would tell anyone suffering, don’t wait, this treatment is truly amazing and it is life altering. Thanks to HemWell America I have my life back and feel amazing.

			I had been suffering with hemorrhoids for about 8 months before I had the treatment. I couldn’t sleep, I would just lay there at night, suffering with itching and bleeding from the internal hemorrhoids. I tried the creams and suppositories that my doctor recommended but nothing would help. I was desperate to find a solution, I couldn’t live my life like this. I had heard the stories about the surgery and banding procedure from friends that would not recommend these treatments. Then one day I was talking to another friend who told me about this treatment that HemWell America offered. At first I thought this is too good to be true, so I made a consultation appointment for the next day. I felt so comfortable with the experienced practitioner and medical assistant that consulted me and performed that initial exam, I immediately had the treatment done that same day. I could not believe the immediate relief I felt from the treatment. It was true what they said about painless and quick. Right after the treatment, I went right back to work, literally right after the treatment. The treatment eliminated my hemorrhoids completely and I no longer suffer. I would highly recommend this treatment and can not believe I suffered so long and did not find out about this sooner.

	Like many women, my symptoms began after having two children one year apart. I suffered with daily bleeding, and often pain, for years. At one point, an episode of bleeding sent me to the doctorʼs office. Although I knew as a physician that the bleeding was classic for hemorrhoids, it was still upsetting to me. After an exam, the doctor confirmed that the bleeding was from hemorrhoids and he gave me a prescription and said in a friendly, joking manner that he would see me the next time I bleed. Sad, but true.</p>
	<p>Treatment is a very personal decision, and the other options were just not for me. When I heard about the treatment done by HemWell America, I was very curious and really excited. EVERYTHING about it sounded great! I scheduled an appointment and had the procedure. It was very quick and I went back to taking care of my little ones as soon as I got home. I havenʼt had any symptoms since then, and that was five years ago.</p>

	I first started noticing minor symptoms about three years ago, not knowing what was causing my discomfort. Over time, the symptoms progressively got worse and became harder to ignore. I decided to do some research online and found out I was experiencing common Hemorrhoid symptoms. There are so many home remedies and over-the-counter products that would alleviate the symptoms but none were solutions to the problem. I was able to keep my symptoms under control but it would still come and go.</p>
	<p>The HemWell’s treatment was the solution to my problem and I only regret not knowing about it sooner. I strongly encourage those suffering from hemorrhoids to get this treatment. It is so quick and painless that it seems almost unreal I dealt with the symptoms for so long.</p>

	I am very happy to share my patient experience.  I received the treatment, and received IMMEDIATE RELIEF of my problematic hemorrhoids, which I found to be incredible, as the treatment only took 10 minutes, and the hemorrhoid causing my symptoms shrunk right before my Provider’s eyes. (Super cool for a mom who has been dealing with my hemorrhoids for over 20 years – all smiles over here). It was also a definite plus to find that the procedure wasn’t painful (truth be told, I was scrolling and messaging on my Facebook account the entire time J)! In conclusion, I will also express my appreciation to the genuine caring and attentiveness of the staff. They went the extra mile to ensure my comfort, which meant a lot to me. Suffice it to say that I am highly satisfied with my HemWell America experience!</p>

	I suffered with hemorrhoids for over 3  years.  Those who suffer with the symptoms understand that it is an embarrassing subject to deal with. I did not immediately seek medical attention but when I eventually saw my physician, she recommended treating my symptoms using the  creams I did not want to use.   I could not move around during the day with cream on me. Hemorrhoids were for me a nuisance!  At first, I was afraid of more pain than I was already feeling, but after the treatment I regret waiting so long to get the much needed help, HemWell America is the best gift I have ever given myself!  Everyone there was so nice and informative about the treatment, they really put my fears to rest. I suffered so long that the next morning, I was sitting in the restroom waiting on the next feeling of pain, or some form of discomfort, and I had to remind myself that I had the treatment and the reason I was sitting there waiting is because I had mentally started accepting that no matter how many creams or other remedies I had previously tried, I was going to suffer for the rest of my life… Wrong!   Now, I smile because I feel brand new and I will forever share my story and the HemWell America experience.  A Special Thanks to Everyone involved you guys are the BEST!</p>

	I have been suffering with hemorrhoids for about 2-3 years and they have progressively gotten worse. I heard about HemWell America through a friend of mine and they told me about the treatment. I finally decided I would go see them and get the treatment. My treatment took a bit longer than 10-minutes because they treated two hemorrhoids. The staff talked with me through the whole treatment to make sure I was comfortable and increased and decreased the millicurrent as needed. I immediately felt improvement and have seen significant improvement and continued healing since the treatment. I can't emphasize enough about the friendly, comforting staff and office environment. The team was very professional and with the calming atmosphere that helped during the treatment. I don't think I could have relaxed without it.  I felt better when I left the appointment; I had no limitations after the treatment.</p>

	Having undergone surgery years ago to correct a debilitating hemorrhoid condition, I avoided a recurrence at all cost. 
But, in spite of my good intentions, problems did develop.   
So I began to inquire among the medical profession as to what options were available in this space age; hoping against hope that someone had come up with something other than surgery, rubber bands or suppositories.  

With a little luck I just happened on an article in the business section (of all places) of the Tribune, reporting a new innovative treatment for hemorrhoids.   
I did further research and was sold on the procedure. 
My testimony is as follows: This is what I was promised; this is what I got:  
No prep time, no down time, no pain time. It’s almost unbelievable! I suggest that you call for your appointment today!

	The treatment helped a lot, it stopped me from hemorrhaging so badly that I was too weak to get out of bed some mornings. Lisa, [Lisa Ferris, the Tampa Provider], is fabulous.

	Very easy to deal with. Answered all my questions and was honest and up-front that this procedure would not address my issue but referred me to someone that might be able to help. I was still given helpful information to help my condition for now.

	The only thing I was a little upset about is I was told that if the surgery was not done, I would pay nothing. There was a forty five dollar charge for the exam, but because everyone I dealt with was so nice, I honestly didn't even mind. Highly recommend.

	Lisa made sure she told me everything she was doing before she did it. She had me tell her if I felt any discomfort so she could lower the setting. It was a good experience.
